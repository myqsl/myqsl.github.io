The QSL card has wrong reception kind. It is not SATelite.
It is really SHORTWAVE reception! Russian service programs are not
broadcasted regulary via shortwaves. But one segment about
news of Slovak culture is transmitted via shortwaves.
WRMI broadcasts a WRN program "Kaleidoskop". The segment
was the part of this program.

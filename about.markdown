Hello and greetings from Moscow!
</p>
<p>
I'm Eugene. My first shortwave and
medium waves listening was around 2000.
The new wave of this wonderful time
comes to me at summer of 2020. And I
was fell into radio with new passions!
</p>
<p>
DXing is fantastic! Radio is like a magic.
I love it very much! I want to share
my passion with you. Please feel perfect
to view my small collection of qsl
cards.
</p>
<p>
I want to say many-many-many thanks
to my dear DX friend <a href="http://qsl-review.blogspot.com">Konstantin Barsenkov</a>
from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. He is
my main source of life in radio nowadays.
Kostya, I'm in a lot of happiness to
deal with you! I think there is no
shortwave program which doesn't mention
"Konstantin Barsenkov from Saint-Petersburg"!
</p>
<p>
I also want to mention our mail-list
with conversations in Russian about
radio and QSL (really, "QSL and more"!):
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rus-radio-dx">deneb-radio-dx</a>.

<p>
Welcome!

Hello and greetings from Moscow!

I'm Eugene. My first shortwave and
medium waves listening was around 2000.
The new wave of this wonderful time
comes to me at summer of 2020. And I
was fell into radio with new passions!

DXing is fantastic! Radio is like a magic.
I love it very much! I want to share
my passion with you. Please feel perfect
to view my small collection of qsl
cards.

I want to say many-many-many thanks
to my dear DX friend [Konstantin Barsenkov](https://qsl-review.blogspot.com)
from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. He is
my main source of life in radio nowadays.
Kostya, I'm in a lot of happiness to
deal with you! I think there is no
shortwave program which doesn't mention
"Konstantin Barsenkov from Saint-Petersburg"!

I also want to mention our mail-list
with conversations in Russian about
radio and QSL (really, "QSL and more"!):
[deneb-radio-dx](https://groups.google.com/g/rus-radio-dx).

Welcome!
